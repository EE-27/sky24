Task 1
    Create a new Django project, connect DRF and make all necessary settings.

Task 2
    Create the following models:

* User: all fields from a normal user, but replace authorisation with email; phone number; city; avatar.
* Course: title, preview (picture), description.
* Lesson: title, description, preview (picture), link to video.

Task 3
    Describe CRUD
* for course and lesson models, but for course do it via ViewSets, and for lesson - via Generic classes.


For the operation of controllers, describe the simplest serializers.
The work of each endpoint should be checked with Postman.
Also at this stage of work we do not care about security and do not close objects and models
from editing even by the simplest authorisation.
