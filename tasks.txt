Task 1
    To save lessons and courses, implement an additional check to ensure that the materials do not
    contain links to third-party resources other than youtube.com.

    That is, links to videos can be attached to materials, but links to third-party educational
    platforms or personal websites cannot.

Task 2
    Add a subscription model for course updates for the user.

    You need to implement an endpoint to set a user's subscription and to remove a user's subscription.

    In this case, when selecting course data, the user should be sent a sign of the current user's
    subscription to the course. That is, it should provide information whether the user is subscribed
    to course updates or not.

Task 3
    Implement pagination to display all lessons and courses.

Task 4
    Write tests that will check the correctness of CRUD lessons and the functionality of the
    subscription to course updates.

    Save the result of test coverage checking.
