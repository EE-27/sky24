Task 1
    Configure the project to use JWT authorisation and close each endpoint with authorisation.

Task 2
    Create a moderator group and give it rights to work with any lessons or courses,
    but without the ability to delete or create new ones. Put the functionality of such a check into controllers.

Task 3
    Describe access rights for objects so that users who are not members of the moderators group can see
    and edit only their own courses and lessons.

    It is better to start groups through the admin and not to implement additional endpoints for this purpose.
